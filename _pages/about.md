## Bio
I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist in lattice QCD at the University of Regensburg. I am strongly interested in computational problem solving, combining the rigor of theoretical physics with a pragmatic, engineering-driven approach. I enjoy working across methods and technologies, from algorithms and modeling to data-driven approaches and low-level systems.

    <b>PhD in Theoretical Physics, Universität Regensburg</b><br>
    I completed my PhD in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZfmG_h5Oyg" target="_blank">lattice QCD</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/physics/hep/people/professors/prof-dr-lehner/index.html" target="blank">Christoph Lehner</a>. My main research focused on the <a href="https://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/the-physics-of-g-2.html" target="_blank">muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2)</a>: I computed the short-distance window of the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization for the first time from first-principles lattice QCD. I carried out the project end-to-end, including HPC simulations, data pipeline design, and statistical analysis. <br> The resulting estimate is cited in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.21476" target="_blank">2025 Muon g-2 Theory Initiative White Paper</a> and contributes to the current Standard Model prediction of the muon g-2. <br><br>
    In parallel, I collaborated with <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/physics/hep/people/professors/bali/index.html" target="_blank">Gunnar Bali</a> and <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/physics/hep/people/professors/prof-dr-sara-collins/index.html" target="_blank">Sara Collins</a> on precision <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarkonium#Charmonium">charmonium</a> spectroscopy. <br><br>
    Towards the end of my PhD, I squeezed in an embedded software development internship at the start-up <a href="https://excav.de/" target="_blank">excav</a> in Erlangen.

    <b>M.Sc. in Physics, Universität Regensburg</b><br>
    During my master’s degree, I specialized in theoretical physics with a focus on lattice QCD and computational methods. My thesis with <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/physics/hep/people/professors/prof-dr-lehner/index.html" target="blank">Christoph Lehner</a> focused on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.5491" target="_blank">algorithmic improvements</a> for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations in lattice field theory (Schwinger model) on HPC systems. <br><br> 
    In addition, I worked as a student assistant at <a href="https://www.bertrandt.com/en/" target="_blank">Bertrandt</a> in their Advanced Driver Assistance Systems team in Regensburg.

## Life outside of work
I have a passion for Olympic weightlifting, functional fitness, and sports in general, which helps me stay grounded after long days in front of a screen.

<br>I like to read, both fiction and non-fiction, especially crime and mystery. Stephen King and Simon Beckett feature prominently on my reading list, with the occasional Yuval Noah Harari or Nassim Nicholas Taleb scattered in. Lately, I don’t find as much time to read as I’d like, but audiobooks have become a welcome way to increase my book count during commutes or during chores. 😉

Occasionally, I also enjoy video games or movies, particularly when they emphasize strong storytelling or offer a unique experience or perspective.
